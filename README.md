# DecisionMaking_MatrixFactorization

### Given a matrix of people's preferences and a matrix of restaurant ratings, the followings were calculated. 
1. Calculate a matrix factorization
2. Determine the best restaurant they can go for lunch as a group
3. Calculate a metric for disatisfaction among the group 
4. Determine if they need to split into more than two groups to minimize disatisfaction
5. K-means clustering used to split into # groups (PCA used to reduce dimensionality of matrix)


# K-means clustering result
